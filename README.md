<h1><b>Peer to Peer Connection System</b></h1>
<h3> Overview of the project: </h3>
<p> This repo consists of a system that helps in peer-peer communication without any packet loss. This happens with the help of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). <br>
TCP is better than UDP when it comes to:<br>
1. No packet loss (No information loss)
2. Sequence of messages that are sent from one peer to another is maintained in this.
3. There might be a bit of latency as compared to UDP, but the tradeoff is good.</p><br>

<h2> About the Repo:</h2>
<p> The <b>peer.py</b> has the testing of a single peer communication with my computer. (Just for testing and understanding<br>
